Very simple arkanoid which has implemented a ball, a player, and one hardcoded level. You can't die here and you can't win here. But basic mechanics such as a ball bouncing from player and bricks are implemented.

If you don't use my project file then you might need to change character set to Multi-Byte: Project -> Properties -> Advanced (or. General for older versions) -> Character Set option to Use Multi-Byte Character Set
Use C++20 compiler to compile the code
Use Release build as with Debug build there will be bugs due to slowness of the build. It could be fixed but need time which I don't have now.

Arrows: Up, Down, Left, Right to control the player

Walls, ceiling and floor make a ball to bounce ( no death )

There is a lot to optimize but need time and desire which I don't have.
